As of fall 2023, I have completed two internships, one at [TC Electric, LLC.](https://www.tcelect.net/), and the other at [ITC Midwest](https://www.itc-holdings.com/itc-midwest).


## Summer 2023: TC Electric

In the Summer of 2023, I interned for 11 weeks at TC Electric's NY midtown field office. There, I worked on the Innovation Team with Jacob Shavel as my mentor. Together with Rachel, a fellow intern, we completed the [Subcontractor Automation Project](https://tce-innovation.github.io/Subcontractor-Automation/), a tool to guide Subcontractors through filling out required MTA forms.

I also created plan view drawings of CMRS for the mock intern project, where all the interns at TCE simulated the award of a new contractor for TCE. 

Though TCE, I finally understood the dynamics of a project team and how to manage a project: both from a startup perspective and a established corporation. You can learn more about my experiences [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/internships/tcElectric.md %}).

## Summer 2022: ITC Holdings

Through the help of [INROADS](https://inroads.org/), I interned for 12 weeks at ITC Midwest, based out of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. ITC Midwest is an owner-operater of high voltage transmission lines throughout the midwest. 

I joined the Line Design group, where my tasks include the following: 
1. Analyze 13 years of electrical outages to study galloping and the effectiveness of T-2 ACSR conductors.
2. Use PLS-CADD to update older Plan and Profiles to create new As-Builts.

Though ITC, I was able to understand how an owner constructs and maintains the infrastructure necessary to power our future. You can learn more about my experiences [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/internships/itcHoldings.md %}).
