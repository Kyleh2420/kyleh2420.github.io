## What is IEEE?

IEEE, or the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers is a student-run professional organization that aims to form a community of electrical engineers and further the knowledge, outreach, and networks of all those involved.

## What did I do in IEEE?

As the secretary for IEEE in the 2023-2024 school year, I lead techncial workshops and planned social events for the general body. These technical events include the Soldering Workshop, OPS, and more. In addition, I completed normal secretary tasks such as minutes and communication with outside entities.


### Soldering Workshop

For the fall 2023 soldering workshop, I created and programmed an ATTiny261A to play Simon Says. Using Fusion360 and JLCPCB, I manufactured a PCB that students would learn to solder on. Ultimately, the goal was to provide students with a credit-card sized trinket that they could be proud of making. 

### Open Program Space

Open Program Space is an initiative began by the IEEE at UCLA, which is designed to teach students of all kind electrical engineering skills: both hardware and software.
