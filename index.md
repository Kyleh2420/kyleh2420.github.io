# About Me

Hello! 

My name is Kyle and I'm a 4th year student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) studying Electrical Engineering, on track for an accelerated Masters in Science in Computer Engineering. I am currently the secretary of the IEEE at SBU Student Chapter, where I coordinate logistics and communication both internally and externally of the club. I am also a member of [Tau Beta Pi](https://www.tbp.org/home.cfm), and joined the Stony Brook Motorsports team on the Electrical Subsystem. In my free time, I like to explore my photography hobby - my go to is a Sony a7ii for digital and Hasselblad 501CM for film.


I am searching for opportunities in the hardware design or research and development sector.


This website is a compilation of my personal projects and experiences. I have linked below some of my coolest projects.

Feel free to explore my projects on the left bar and contact me at: [kyleh2420@gmail.com](mailto:kyleh24202gmail.com) if there you have any questions.

Thanks for stopping by!
