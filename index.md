# About Me

Hello! My name is Kyle and I'm a 4th year student at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) studying Electrical Engineering, on track for an accelerated Masters in Science in Computer Engineering. I am a part of the Motorsports Club and the secretary for the IEEE at SBU Student Organization. Currently, I am searching for opportunities in the hardware design or reserach and development sector.


This website is a compilation of my personal projects and experiences. Feel free to explore my projects on the left bar and contact me at: [kyleh2420@gmail.com](mailto:kyleh24202gmail.com) if there you have any questions.

Thanks for stopping by!
